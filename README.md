# Power Query
Just some functions used in Power Query to make things easier.

I don't like spending time cleaning, comparing, setting up, and preparing data at all. 

I'd rather spend 80% of time on analysis and 20% of time on preperation rather than the reverse.

I plan to add just random functions that helps me out at work so I can minimize time spent preping data.
